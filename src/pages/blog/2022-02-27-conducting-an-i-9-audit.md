### ***Conducting an I-9 Audit***

When companies establish and maintain effective Form I-9 compliance policies, employers can prevent potential liability and exorbitant fines as well as mitigate many potential violations. Employers should implement effective I-9 procedures that result in accurate, consistent and uniform preparation, maintenance and, ultimately, disposal of the forms.

When was the last time you conducted an I-9 Forms audit? Here are some guidelines to assist you and a complete checklist for the process can be found at [www.hrstrategies.org](http://www.hrstrategies.org) :

* Employers must have an I-9 on file for every active employee hired after November 6, 1986.
* Employers must have an I-9 on file for terminated employees for three years following date of hire or one year following date of terminationâ€”whichever is later.
* The current version of the I-9 form as of the date of hire or reverification must be used.

***Items Needed for Audit:***

* List of current employees hired since November 6, 1986.
* List of employees terminated in the past three years.
* Original or electronic copies of all I-9 forms (both current employee forms, as well as forms for terminated employees within current retention requirements).
* *Handbook for Employers M-274* published by the USCIS (optional)
* Current version of Form I-9
* Audit Log
