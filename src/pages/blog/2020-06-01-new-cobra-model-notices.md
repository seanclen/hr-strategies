## ***New COBRA Model Notices and Extended Deadlines***

In early May, the Department of Labor (DOL) issued two new model COBRA notices – the initial (also called general) notice and the election notice. At the same time, the DOL working with the Department of the Treasury (the Departments) extended certain COBRA deadlines in response to COVID-19.

The revised model notices provide additional information to address COBRA’s interaction with Medicare. The model notices explain that there may be advantages to enrolling in Medicare before, or instead of, electing COBRA. It also highlights that if an individual is eligible for both COBRA and Medicare, electing COBRA coverage may impact enrollment into Medicare as well as certain out-of-pocket costs.

These new model documents are available at [www.dol.gov/agencies/ebsa/laws-and-regulations/laws/cobra](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/ebsa/laws-and-regulations/laws/cobra)[](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/ebsa/laws-and-regulations/laws/cobra). They will provide important information to COBRA-eligible individuals as they make healthcare choices for themselves and their families while assisting employers that must comply with the notice requirements under COBRA.
