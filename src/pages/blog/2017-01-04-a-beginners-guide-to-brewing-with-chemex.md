  Brewing with a Chemex probably seems like a complicated, time-consuming
  ordeal, but once you get used to the process, it becomes a soothing ritual
  that's worth the effort every time.

## The OFCCP is getting busy.

Another agency that has increased their activities is the _Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP)_.  Several federal contractors in our area have received letters for compliance review, otherwise considered an audit.  They are determining [compliance](/compliance) with the **Executive Order 11246**, Section 503 of the **Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Section 503)**, the **Vietnam Era Veterans’ Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974 (VEVRAA)** and their implementing regulations in **41 CFR Chapter 60**.  

In addition to determining compliance with these authorities, they will also verify compliance with the regulations issued by the Veteran’s Employment and Training Service (VETS) requiring contractors and subcontractors covered by VEVRAA to file an annual report on their employment and hiring of protected veterans. 

## What does this mean to you?

_If your company doesn’t have 2019, 2018, and 2017 AAPs to meet the OFCCP compliance requirements, you are at risk._

Contact [HR Strategies, LLC](/contact) to have your [AAP](/compliance/affirmative-action) developed so that your company is not in jeopardy.  Under the Freedom of Information Act, you are able to review the outcome of compliance reviews and conciliation agreements which show violations and specific remedies and requirements contractors have had to implement.
