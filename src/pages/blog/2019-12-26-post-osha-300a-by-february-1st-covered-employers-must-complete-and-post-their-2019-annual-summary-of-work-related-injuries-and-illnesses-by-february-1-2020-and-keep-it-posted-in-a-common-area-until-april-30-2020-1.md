Covered employers must complete and post their 2019 annual summary of work-related injuries and illnesses by February 1, 2020, and keep it posted in a common area until April 30, 2020. All employers required to keep Form 300, the Injury and Illness Log, must utilize the annual summary Form 300A to comply with posting requirements even if there have been no recordable injuries or illnesses, as the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) will continue to focus on record-keeping violations in 2020. This year’s summary must include the total number of job-related injuries and illnesses that occurred in 2019.

The summary Form 300A reports a business’s total year-end number of fatalities, missed workdays due to injury or illness on the job, job transfers or restrictions, and injuries and illnesses as recorded on Form 300. It also includes the number of employees and the hours they worked for the year.
