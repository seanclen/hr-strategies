## ***New Voluntary Self-identification Form***

The Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs announced the release of a new and "streamlined" Voluntary Self-Identification of Disability form. The regulations implementing Section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act require federal contractors to invite applicants and new hires to self-identify as having a disability. Contractors must also invite employees to self-identify as disabled at least once every five years. These invitations must be made using the form approved by the Office of Management and Budget and can be found on [www.dol.gov/agencies/ofccp/self-id-forms](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/ofccp/self-id-forms). Please replace the old form with the new form for future new hires.

The disclosure of disability status is voluntary; applicants and employees may identify as having a disability, or they may choose not to respond at all. However, contractors use the responses to determine whether the workforce achieves the seven percent representation goal for individuals with a disability on an annual basis.
