description: >
  The Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA) was recently passed to
  provide paid sick leave and expanded family and medical leave to certain
  eligible workers for specified reasons related to COVID-19. The FFCRA goes
  into effect April 1. This means that those employers with less than 500
  employees must comply with the notice provisions of the FFCRA by April 1.

Each covered employer must post in a conspicuous place on its premises a notice of the FFCRA requirements. An employer can satisfy this requirement by emailing or direct mailing the Notice to employees, or posting the Notice on an employee information internal or external website. Employers are not required to post the Notice in multiple languages, but the DOL is working to translate the Notice into other languages. The Notice needs to be displayed in a conspicuous place where employees can see it. If employees are able to see it at the main office, it is not necessary to display the Notice at an employerâ€™s different worksite locations. Where an employer has employees reporting directly to work in several different buildings, the employer must post the Notice (in addition to all other required federal and state notices) in each building, even if the buildings are located in the same general vicinity (e.g., in an industrial park or on a campus). Employers must also convey this Notice to newly hired applicants, either by email, direct mail, or by posting the Notice on the premises or on an employee information internal or external website.
