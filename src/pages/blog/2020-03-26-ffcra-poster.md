The Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA or Act) requires certain employers to provide their
 employees with paid sick leave and expanded family and medical leave for specified reasons related to COVID-19. These provisions will apply from April 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020. Each covered employer must post this notice of the FFCRA requirements in a conspicuous place on its premises. An employer may satisfy this requirement by emailing or direct mailing this notice to employees, or posting this notice on an employee information internal or external website. These provisions will apply from April 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020.
