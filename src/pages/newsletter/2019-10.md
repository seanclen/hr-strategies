# Time is Running Out to Meet Training Requirements

The new Delaware law specifically addresses the prohibition against sexual harassment under the Delaware Discrimination in Employment Act (DDEA), sets an affirmative defense for employers, imposes mandatory notice distribution on employers with at least four employees within the state, and provides anti-sexual harassment training requirements for employers with at least 50 employees in the state.  The new law became effective on January 1, 2019.

## 
What should employers do?

* Delaware employers should review their policies to ensure their sexual harassment prevention policies are consistent with the new law. 
* Employers must be distributing the Department of Labor’s Notice to each new employee and have distributed the notice to all employee by July 1, 2019.  A copy of the Information Sheet is available on [www.hrstrategies.org](www.hrstrategies.org). 


This is a great time for employers to update their training programs to meet the new Delaware law’s interactive training requirements and to schedule training to ensure they are meeting the law’s training compliance dates. HR Strategies, LLC is available to assist in customizing and presenting interactive training programs consistent with Delaware’s training requirements. Since the new regulation became effective, we have trained over 3000 employees and managers in harassment prevention.  We further are able to review and update workplace policies, including an employer’s sexual harassment prevention policy.

## 
Mandatory Sexual Harassment Training Required:  

Employers with at least 50 employees in Delaware must provide “interactive training and education to employees regarding the prevention of sexual harassment.” Training must be completed by 12/31/19 and include all of the following elements:

1. The illegality of sexual harassment;
2. The definition of sexual harassment using examples;
3. The legal remedies and complaint process available to the employee;
4. Directions on how to contact the Department of Labor; and the EEOC
5. The legal prohibition against retaliation.


In addition, the interactive training for the supervisors must further include the specific responsibilities of a supervisor regarding the prevention and correction of sexual harassment; and the legal prohibition against retaliation.
