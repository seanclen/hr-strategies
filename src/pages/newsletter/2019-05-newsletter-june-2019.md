# **Are your employees classified correctly?**

Under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (FLSA), employees are to be paid at a rate of at least one and a half times their regular rate for any hours worked over 40 in a week, unless they have been classified as exempt under certain specific statutory categories or meet other requirements in the regulations. 

Under Section 541 of the FLSA regulations, an employee may qualify as exempt from overtime requirements if he or she satisfies a “primary duties test” (performs specific job responsibilities under the executive, administrative, professional, computer and outside sales regulations); is paid on a salary basis (salary does not fluctuate based on the hours that the individual works); and is paid above a salary threshold set by regulation. Under the current regulations, employees must be paid more than $455 per week ($23,660 per year) to satisfy the salary threshold for exemption.

The new rules may become effective as early as this month and employers will have 60 days to comply.  Prepare now and use the expertise of a consultant or an attorney to ensure compliance.  Some of the items that employers must do are as follows:

* Review job descriptions to ensure that they are classified correctly and are in compliance.  This is more than a cursory glance, it involves reviewing the scope and responsibilities of the position to determine if and which exemption status would be applicable.
* Audit exempt workforce decisions to ensure that the position meets the primary duties test. 

As a result of the new rule, companies may also have to make adjustments to salaries and restructure compensation plans to comply with the new threshold.
