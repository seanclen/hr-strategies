## Active Shooter Preparedness and Response

The most effective workplace violence prevention plan is one that is put in place long before trouble occurs. Employees need to understand what to do in an emergency and what the company's response will be.  

Each year, an average of nearly 2 million American workers report having been a victim of violence at work, according to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. And the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics puts the number of annual workplace homicides at about 400.

Who in your company has the responsibility to make sure workers know how to stay safe in the face of a threat?  Contact HR Strategies for on-site training on Active Shooter Preparedness and Response.  Below is an example of guidelines and what to do in the event of an emergency and active shooter, for your consideration:

## Action Guidelines

**Evacuate – Run:** If there is an accessible escape path, attempt to evacuate the premises. Be sure to:

* Have an escape route and plan in mind.
* Evacuate regardless of whether others agree to follow.	
* Leave your belongings behind.	
* Help others evacuate, if possible.
* Call 911 when you are safe.
* Prevent individuals from entering an area where the active shooter may be.
* Keep your hands visible.
* Follow the instructions of any police officers.
* Do not attempt to move wounded people.

**Shelter-in-Place – Hide:** If evacuation is not possible, find a place to hide where the active shooter is less likely to find you. Your hiding place should:

* Be out of the active shooter’s view.
* Provide protection if shots are fired in your direction (i.e. an office with a closed and locked door).
* Not trap you or restrict your options for movement.
* To prevent an active shooter from entering your hiding place:
  1. Lock the door.
  2. Blockade the door with heavy furniture.
* If the active shooter is nearby:
  1. Lock the door.
  2. Silence your cell phone and/or pager.
  3. Turn off any source of noise (i.e. radio, television).                                                                                        4.  Hide behind large items (i.e. cabinets, desks).
  4. Remain quiet.

**Protect Yourself – Fight:**  As a last resort, and only when your life is in imminent danger, attempt to disrupt and/or incapacitate the active shooter by:

* Acting as aggressively as possible against him/her.
* Throwing items and improvising weapons.
* Yelling.
* Committing to your actions.

**When Police Arrive**

* Put down any items in your hands.
* Keep hands visible.	
* Follow all instructions.
* Avoid making quick movements towards officers.	
* Do not stop to ask officers for help or direction when evacuating, just proceed in the direction from which officers are entering the premises.

# Monthly Reminders

**Due September 30th Medical Loss Ratio Rebates:** are mandated under the Affordable Care Act whenever health insurers do not spend at least a certain percentage (generally, 80% to 85%) of the prior year's health insurance premiums on health care services. If they fail to meet these standards, the insurance companies are required to provide a rebate to their customers.

**Due September 30th EEO-1 Component 2/Pay-Data Reporting:**  Businesses with at least 100 employees and federal contractors with at least 50 employees and a contract with the federal government of $50,000 or more must file Component 1 of the EEO-1 form. However, only employers with at least 100 employees, including federal contractors, must file Component 2.

**Due September 30th VETS-4212:** The VETS-4212 reporting requirements apply to all federal contractors and subcontractors with a government contract in the amount of $150,000 or more at any point during 2018.

**Due December 31st Harassment Prevention Training:** Delaware employers with 50 or more workers must complete interactive harassment prevention training.
 Call HR Strategies to schedule your companies training before time runs out.

# Legislative Updates

**NJFLA:** The NJFLA previously applied to employers with 50 or more employees. The amendment reduces the employer size threshold to just 30 employees. Now, employers with 30 or more employees (in total, anywhere) are required to provide those employees working in New Jersey with 12 weeks of job-protected family leave during each 24-month period.

**D.C. Universal Paid Leave Act:** The D.C. Universal Paid Leave Act has incredibly broad reach. All employers that directly or indirectly employ or exercise control over the terms and conditions of employees working in D.C. and that are required to pay unemployment insurance on behalf of their employees are covered by the Act regardless of whether the employer has a physical location in D.C.

The Act creates a paid leave system funded by employers for those employed in D.C. "Covered employers" are required to contribute an amount equal to 0.62 percent of the wages of each of their "covered employees" to the Universal Paid Leave Implementation Fund. "Eligible individuals" may then file a claim for paid leave benefits for a "qualifying leave event," with those benefits to be paid out of the Fund.

**MD Ban the Box:**  

* **Baltimore -** All employers with 10 or more employees; No criminal records checks or inquiries until a conditional job offer has been made
* **Montgomery County -** Any employer employing 15 or more persons in the county; No criminal history questions or background checks until after first interview
* **Prince George’s County -** Any employer with 25 or more full-time employees in the county; No criminal history questions or background checks until after first interview

**Philadelphia's Fair Workweek Employment Standards Ordinance:** Effective 1/1/20 - Under Philadelphia's Fair Workweek Employment Standards Ordinance, large retail, hospitality and food service establishments will be required to

1. give existing employees the right of first refusal to work additional hours before hiring new employees;
2. post and provide advance written notice of work schedules;
3. provide predictability pay for any departures from the posted schedules; and 
4. permit a rest period of nine hours between shifts.

**New Jersey Mandates Panic Buttons for Hotel Workers:**  Effective 1/1/20 - New Jersey has enacted a law requiring hotels with at least 100 guest rooms to provide employees in housekeeping or room service with panic devices. The law also sets record-keeping and security protocol requirements covered hotels must comply with.

The Legislature enacted the law to protect workers (whom the law characterizes as marginalized members of society) from assault, sexual assault, and harassment.

**New Jersey Restricts Pay History Inquiries:**  Effective 1/1/20 - On July 25, New Jersey Lieutenant Gov. Sheila Oliver signed Bill A1094 into law. Like other recent laws limiting salary-history inquiries, New Jersey's law prohibits employers from screening job applicants based on the applicant's prior salary history, which includes prior wages, salary and benefits. 

In addition, employers may not require that an applicant's salary history satisfy any minimum or maximum threshold to be considered for a job. 

**New Jersey Wage Theft Act:** On August 6, 2019, Acting Governor Sheila Oliver signed the New Jersey Wage Theft Act (WTA) into law. The law has been touted by proponents as the toughest wage theft statute in the country. Notwithstanding its name, the WTA goes far beyond attempting to prevent and punish intentional "wage theft" by significantly expanding the liability even the best-intentioned employers will face for state wage law violations.

The majority of the WTA took effect immediately, amending a host of existing New Jersey civil and criminal statutes.

For most employers, one critical takeaway is that the WTA requires employers to provide current and newly hired employees a written statement of wage rights, which will be produced by the New Jersey Department of Labor and Workforce Development (NJDOL).
