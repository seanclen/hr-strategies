  ### **Summer Vacations Are Back**


  Summer is right around the corner and that means summer vacations! After the past few years of limited travel or not taking vacations due to the pandemic, many people have accrued more time off than they have ever had before. Your employees will begin requesting time off for vacation, so this is a good time to review your vacation policies and procedures to ensure they are legally compliant and work with your business needs.

### **Summer Vacations Are Back**

Summer is right around the corner and that means summer vacations! After the past few years of limited travel or not taking vacations due to the pandemic, many people have accrued more time off than they have ever had before. Your employees will begin requesting time off for vacation, so this is a good time to review your vacation policies and procedures to ensure they are legally compliant and work with your business needs.

For the most part, employees aren’t promised paid vacations unless employers agree to provide paid vacation through a policy, practice, or contract. Exceptions include some state or local paid sick leave laws. But once an employer decides to offer paid vacation then there are important factors that need to be considered when addressing their vacation policy:

* **Use of vacation time**– There should be guidelines and restrictions when it comes to the use of vacation times. Such things as advanced notice, management approval, and scheduling conflicts. If these guidelines are not set in place, then too many employees could take vacations at the same time and not leave enough coverage at the workplace.
* **Approving and denying vacation requests**– Vacation requests should be upheld to a nondiscriminatory approval/denial process so as not to show any form of favoritism. A good way of doing so would be approving/denying by timing of the request or by seniority.
* **No working during vacation**– In any circumstance that a non-exempt employee is called upon for any work (be it through telephone calls, text message or email on their mobile device), they are to be compensated for the work in lieu of their vacation time.
* **Accrual limits**– Place a limit on the amount of vacation time that can accrued if employees are allowed (or entitled by state law) to roll over their vacation time from year-to-year.
* **Allowing vacation advances**– If allowing advancement on paid vacation that has yet to be accrued, provide precise guidance on doing so as not to allow employees to take advantage of such advances. Paid vacation time taken before being accrued can make it difficult to deduct advances from wages or an employee’s final pay upon termination.
* **Other guidance**– Provide guidance on whether employees may or may not receive pay in lieu of vacation, whether vacation time must be taken in specified increments, if vacation time will not continue to accrue during unpaid leaves of absence, whether an employee who becomes ill during vacation leave can treat the period of illness as sick leave instead, and whether a holiday that falls during a vacation period will be treated as a vacation day.
* **Leave laws**– Fully explain the use of vacation time in conjunction with the Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA) or any other leaves laws, including equivalent state laws.

### **Improve Your Performance Reviews**

Here's how to make the review process more palatable for both managers and their direct reports:

* Don't limit conversations to once or twice per year. Every team is different, so leaders should decide what schedule is most appropriate for their departments. However, it's important to deal with any problems as they arise; don't let them fester.
* Set performance goals and expectations at the beginning of the year so employees understand their responsibilities. This helps lend objectivity to the process by introducing measurable targets. However, the goals should be adjusted if there are major changes to the business or an employee's circumstances.
* Explain how each employee’s position, as well as each department, fits into the company's overall strategy. This will help employees understand why their job matters and why it's important.
* Simplify the process. There's no need for a double-digit number of steps or numerous questions that require long-winded answers.
* Consider a 360-degree approach. Input from employees' colleagues or from other managers can help give a fuller picture of employees' capabilities and contributions.
* Eliminate proximity bias. You may not see some employees as often as others, especially if they work remotely, but that doesn't mean they're not working hard.
* End recency bias, which is basing a review on an employee's most recent performance while ignoring earlier efforts. Don't let recent mistakes overshadow the employees other impressive accomplishments.
* Solicit feedback from employees. Reviews should be a two-way conversation not a lecture.
* Train managers to give advice calmly and helpfully. This is especially important when leaders must call out an employee's subpar performance.
* Don't discuss compensation during reviews. Employees are likely to be so focused on learning about a raise or a bonus that they won't pay much attention to anything else.
