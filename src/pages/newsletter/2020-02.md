  Managing employee performance is the most important part of a manager’s job. A
  manager, by definition, does not get paid for what they do, but for what the
  employees who work for them do. Recognizing this, good managers do everything
  in their power to help employees succeed. Yet, even for successful managers,
  some employees are simply more difficult.

## Time to Update Your AAP’s

Many Affirmative Action Plans (AAPs) expired on December 31, 2019. Under federal law, government contractors and subcontractors with 50 or more employees who have entered into at least one contract of $50,000 or more with the federal government must prepare and maintain a written affirmative action program, which must be developed within 120 days from the commencement of the contract and **must be updated annually.**  

AAP’s should be submitted to DOL during the first quarter of 2020. 

**Reminder:  Contractors should resurvey their workforces with Voluntary Self-Identification of Disability**

The regulations that updated Section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 took effect on March 24, 2014. These updates required federal contractors and subcontractors to invite their employees to voluntarily self-identify their status as an individual with a disability using the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs’ (OFCCP) official invitation, [Form CC-305](https://www.dol.gov/ofccp/regs/compliance/sec503/Self_ID_Forms/SelfIDForms.htm) and require that contractors resurvey their workforces at least once every five years, as well as issue at least one reminder between invitations.

## Post OSHA 300A by February 1st 

Covered employers must complete and post their 2019 annual summary of work-related injuries and illnesses by February 1, 2020, and keep it posted in a common area until April 30, 2020. All employers required to keep Form 300, the Injury and Illness Log, must utilize the annual summary Form 300A to comply with posting requirements even if there have been no recordable injuries or illnesses, as the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) will continue to focus on record-keeping violations in 2020. This year’s summary must include the total number of job-related injuries and illnesses that occurred in 2019. 

The summary Form 300A reports a business’s total year-end number of fatalities, missed workdays due to injury or illness on the job, job transfers or restrictions, and injuries and illnesses as recorded on Form 300. It also includes the number of employees and the hours they worked for the year.
