# EEO Reporting Checklist

For 2019, the deadline to submit EEO-1 data on job category, race, sex and ethnicity of employees has been extended to May 31, 2019. Additional data that includes hours worked and pay information from employees' W-2 forms by race, ethnicity and sex will be required by September 30, 2019. Please visit the EEO-1 website for updates.

<!-- end -->

* Determine if a company is required to complete the EEO-1 Report.
  1. All private employers with 100 or more employees. 
  2. All federal contractors and first-tier subcontractors with 50 or more employees.
  3. Contracts of at least $50,000 are obligated to complete and file the report each year. 
* Determine which form must be completed
  1. Single-establishment companies: Standard 100 Form
  2. Multi-establishment companies: File a report covering the headquarters office.  File a separate report for each branch with 50 or more employees. A consolidated report also will need to be completed with all employees who work at branches with fewer than 50 employees.
* Select one (1) pay period within the fourth quarter (October, November, or December) of the current survey year to complete the EEO-1 Report.
* Ensure self-identification forms and data are available from each employee during pay period selected.  Organize employee data by listing all employees by location, job category and then by ethnicity, race and gender.
* Gather pay and hours worked data. The reported hours worked should show actual hours worked by nonexempt employees, and an estimated 20 hours per week for part-time exempt employees and 40 hours per week for full-time exempt employees.
* Complete the EEO-1 Report online on or before March 31st following the reporting year. (extended to May 31st for 2019)
* Start the filing process by completing the [EEO-1 Online Application](https://egov.eeoc.gov/eeo1/login). First-time filers will need to [register](https://egov.eeoc.gov/eeo1/register) prior to completing the EEO-1 Report.
* Follow the prompts to enter employment data into online form. If an employer has challenges entering the data, the EEOC Users Guide includes helpful information including a troubleshooting section.
* Retain records for at least one year from the date of the making of the record.

# What Should Be Documented?

Sometimes we think about what an employee says or does and believe it’s not a big deal, so we don’t document the situation.  Often this is not the correct action.  These situations tend to repeat themselves and become bigger issues because they haven’t been addressed.

Documentation can be as easy as keeping a diary or a log that can capture the good, bad and the ugly about your direct reports.  A suggestion would be to keep an excel spreadsheet with a tab for each employee.  At the end of each day, take a minute to reflect on what transpired throughout the day and document any behaviors or actions of your staff for later reference.  

### Samples

Below are some samples of negative employee behaviors or actions that should be at a minimum noted in the log/diary or to begin the corrective coaching process:

* Disputes with a co-worker or customer
* Personal cell phone use during work hours
* A hygiene problem, that can no longer be ignored
* Views inappropriate material on company systems
* Frequently uses company resources (i.e. phone, internet, supplies) for personal reasons
* Lacks attention to detail in their work
* Missing assignments and quotas or is slow to accomplish tasks
* Receives poor customer feedback
* Struggles during introductory period
* Covers up for co-worker
* Hard time following through or seems to get minimal work completed

It is just as important to keep notes on the positive contributions your employees make so that they can be reinforced.  Proper and timely documentation protects your organization, provides employees with clear expectations and celebrates their successes.
