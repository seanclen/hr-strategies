### ***Performance Reviews***

The performance review is a crucial part of the ongoing dialogue between managers and employees. It summarizes ongoing performance and development conversations and provides a record of past performance and expectations for work moving forward.

### Outcome of Effective Performance Evaluations:

* Shared responsibility in a collaborative and open feedback process
* Recognition for contributions and coaching for improvements
* Alignment of individual tasks to team and departmental goals
* Clarification of expectations and resources
* Commitment to continuous improvement and follow-through

### Best Practices for the Performance Review Process:

* Manager and employee review job description and update as needed
* Employee submits written Self-Assessment to manager
* Manager solicits multi-rater feedback from colleagues, customers, and direct reports
* Manager documents performance in written Annual Performance Review
* Annual and mid-year conversations are held to align and adjust expectations and goals
* Annual performance reviews should be linked to Annual Salary Review
* Manager and employee regularly discuss progress towards performance and development goals

### Preparing for the Performance Review:

When both the manager and employee prepare for the performance review, it can lead to an effective and meaningful review process. Begin the process by:

* Reviewing documents and conversations

  * Last year’s performance review
  * Mid-year check-ins
  * Job description
  * Employee Self-Assessment
  * Notes accumulated during the year
* Identifying the following:

  * Accomplishments
  * Progress on goals
  * Areas of exceptional performance
  * Areas of growth
  * Additional responsibilities taken on
  * Contributions to special projects
  * Challenges encountered
  * Areas where development is needed or desired
  * Key messages to convey

### Writing the performance review

* Use clear, concise language to describe:

  * Performance compared to agreed-upon expectations
  * Key accomplishments and contributions
  * Examples of strengths and development opportunities
  * Key expectations for the coming year
* Focus on observable and measurable performance
* Cite specific examples
* Provide actionable feedback
* Avoid vague statements and exaggerations
* Celebrate successes and position shortfalls as an opportunity for learning and adjustment
* Use bullet points, if desired

### Preparing for the Performance Review Conversation:

The most important aspect of a performance review is the review conversation. Preparing for the conversation will help guide a productive conversation. Consider what to communicate and what you want to learn:

* Review accomplishments, strengths, obstacles, and areas for development
* Consider achievement towards goals and what might be needed moving forward
* Determine the most important messages to convey
* Determine the right setting and amount of time needed for the conversation
* Be prepared to give and receive feedback

### Having the Performance Review Conversation:

During the performance review conversation, the manager and employee should:

* Review any agreed-upon “next steps” or commitments from the most recent performance conversation
* Review successes since the last conversation, making sure to identify specific results achieved
* Review any obstacles encountered since the last conversation. Why did they arise? What are some possible ways to deal with them?
* Establish SMART goals for moving forward (Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic, Time-bound)

### After the Performance Review Conversation:

Following the performance review conversation, the manager and employee should:

* Record notes from the meeting
* Reflect on how the meeting went and what you could do differently for future meetings
* Plan for follow-up discussion on any open issues and to check in on goals
