# Low unemployment rates are affecting recruitment and retention

The national unemployment rate is 3.6 percent and provides job-hunters with the advantage of being in a buyer’s market. What does this mean for employers?  The competition to hire is intense and employers must be quick and creative in their recruiting processes.  Employers must sharpen their pencils when it comes to evaluating their total rewards.  It’s more important than ever that the compensation being offered for positions accurately reflects what the market dictates.  We never want to lose a talented person because another company is willing to offer them $5,000 more per year or a more robust benefits package and time off.  Take the time, before it’s too late, to help ensure employees stay engaged, motivated and loyal.We also have had to become more innovative in recruiting new employees and in particular millennials. Studies indicate millennials are looking for a career package that includes career mobility, diversity of responsibilities, a work/life balance and a culture that values social responsibility. These same requirements play sharply into holding on to employees since the best retention strategy is often a strong recruiting strategy. With that in mind, you should evaluate the most critical positions in the organization.  Make sure the compensation being offered accurately reflects the value of the position based on a compensation survey.  If it doesn’t, use the opportunity to adjust the compensation before the individual starts looking elsewhere and let them know how much they are valued by the organization.Recruiting and retaining top employees is vitally important to any business. Organizations with a solid strategy are more likely to succeed in matching the best people to the right jobs – and in keeping them on board.HR Strategies, LLC can help you with compensation surveys to assure you are strategically hiring and retaining your employees.
