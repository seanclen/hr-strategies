  **Preparing your employees for their next career step**


  Often a manager will have an employee that they value for their hard work and
  contributions to the organization and want to reward the employee with an
  increase or a bonus in recognition of their contributions.  This is well
  received in the moment and is also a very short lived acknowledgement of their
  value to the organization.  It’s important to recognize and reward these
  employees for their efforts and maybe you should consider investing your time
  in addition to money to their development.

# Preparing your employees for their next career step

Often a manager will have an employee that they value for their hard work and contributions to the organization and want to reward the employee with an increase or a bonus in recognition of their contributions.  This is well received in the moment and is also a very short lived acknowledgement of their value to the organization.  It’s important to recognize and reward these employees for their efforts and maybe you should consider investing your time in addition to money to their development.  Consider providing your employee with stretch opportunities until their reach their full potential.

Here are some examples of how you can prepare employees for future opportunities. 

**Ask your employee for their opinion or recommendation.** Give them an opportunity to share their ideas and perspectives on areas outside of their normal realm of responsibility. 

**Help your employee build relationships.** Give your employee an opportunity to work with people in other parts of the organization.  This can happen by working on team projects, sharing resources when there is a business need, etc.  This will give the employee a chance to learn about other parts of the business, interact with other business leaders, and expand their knowledge base.

**Nominate your employee to take the lead of a project.** Encouraging an employee to take the lead in a project gives them the opportunity to lead people, processes and resources.  Part of becoming and being an effective leader is showing people that you can successfully lead.  This can be the first step in proving that they have leadership capabilities that may open up doors for them as a future leader in the organization. 

**Financial literacy.** Provide your employee with the chance to develop their knowledge of financial literacy. Having the chance to review and be taught how your organization runs a project, how to read, help forecast and eventually be responsible for some part of the financials is critical to all future leaders. 

**Opportunities to shadow.** Allowing and encouraging an employee to shadow you or another manager to learn about a new project or process.  Having them sit in on project meetings to see how a meeting is run or to brainstorm a new idea or initiative for the organization.  You never know what their perspectives and ideas may bring to take the company to the next level!

# New Hire Reporting

Federal law requires employers to report basic information on new and rehired employees within 20 days of hire to the state where the new employees work. Some states require it sooner. The information is maintained in the National Directory of New Hires, which child support agencies use to locate and issue an income withholding order for parents who owe child support.

## **What information must an employer report?**

Federal law requires you to collect and report these seven data elements:

1. Employee’s name
2. Employee's address
3. Social Security number (SSN)
4. Date of hire (the date the employee first performs services for pay)
5. Employer’s name
6. Employer's address
7. Federal Employer Identification number (FEIN)

Some states require additional data, **_check your state’s reporting requirements_.**

## **Where and how does an employer report new hires?**

You must report new hires to the state where your new employees work. The state forwards the information to the National Directory of New Hires. Federal agencies report new hires directly to the National Directory of New Hires.

# Employee Handbooks

A properly drafted employee handbook relays valuable information about the organization and its policies.  It helps management promote non-arbitrary, consistent application of its policies and practices.  However, lawsuits based on language contained in employee handbooks and other written employment policies are common.  Because improperly drafted employee handbooks and policy and procedure manuals can appear to be contractual, potential problems arise for employers.  

Employers should continuously review their handbooks and policy and procedure manuals to determine whether they contain language that can lead to a wrongful discharge suit or other employment claim.  They should also be reviewed to ensure that the handbooks are current with new legislation or revised legislation that is ever-changing.

Lastly, when distributing a handbook or policy and procedure manual to employees, it should always follow the specific terms and conditions of employment described in the document and ensure your exposure to litigation is minimized.

# Time is Running Out to Meet Training Requirements

The new Delaware law specifically addresses the prohibition against sexual harassment under the Delaware Discrimination in Employment Act (DDEA), sets an affirmative defense for employers, imposes mandatory notice distribution on employers with at least four employees within the state, and provides anti-sexual harassment training requirements for employers with at least 50 employees in the state.  The new law became effective on January 1, 2019.

## What should employers do?  

* Delaware employers should review their policies to ensure their sexual harassment prevention policies are consistent with the new law. 
* Employers must be distributing the Department of Labor’s Notice to each new employee and have distributed the notice to all employee by **July 1, 2019**.  A copy of the Information Sheet is available on [www.hrstrategies.org](www.hrstrategies.org). 

This is a great time for employers to update their training programs to meet the new Delaware law’s interactive training requirements and to schedule training to ensure they are meeting the law’s training compliance dates. HR Strategies, LLC is available to assist in customizing and presenting interactive training programs consistent with Delaware’s training requirements. Since the new regulation became effective, we have trained over 3000 employees and managers in harassment prevention.  We further are able to review and update workplace policies, including an employer’s sexual harassment prevention policy.

## Mandatory Sexual Harassment Training Required:  

Employers with at least 50 employees in Delaware must provide “interactive training and education to employees regarding the prevention of sexual harassment.” Training must be completed by 12/31/19 and include all of the following elements:

1. The illegality of sexual harassment;
2. The definition of sexual harassment using examples;
3. The legal remedies and complaint process available to the employee;
4. Directions on how to contact the Department of Labor; and the EEOC
5. The legal prohibition against retaliation.

In addition, the interactive training for the supervisors must further include the specific responsibilities of a supervisor regarding the prevention and correction of sexual harassment; and the legal prohibition against retaliation.
