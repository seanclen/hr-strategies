      HR Strategies has been on board with us for over twenty years. Tricia and staff handle all aspects of our HR needs, including, but not limited to, new employee orientation, exit interviews, health care benefits and harassment training just to name a few.  Being a volunteer organization without an office staff, bringing Tricia and her staff on board was the best business decision we made.

      As the need for standard business practices and policies evolve, so did the need for our company's handbook. In doing so we were faced with incorporating HR policies and procedures. Having known Tricia from networking and her professional career in HR Strategies we decided to reach out for advice on implementing HR into our handbook. Having experience working with Tricia about HR there would be no other option to work with anyone else.
