    ## It's The Law:


    Under **federal law**, government contractors and subcontractors with 50 or
    more employees who have entered into **at least one contract** of $50,000 or
    more with the federal government must prepare and maintain a written
    affirmative action program, which must be developed within 120 days from the
    commencement of the contract and **must be updated annually**.

history:
  caption: John . Kennedy
  content: >-
    First signed by President John F. Kennedy, the first iteration of AAP
    required that government contractors "take affirmative action to ensure that
    applicants are employed, and employees are treated during employment,
    without regard to their race, creed, color, or national origin"




    Over the years [ammendments have been
    passed](/compliance/affirmative-action#ammendments). Discrimination based on
    sex is prohibited and recently new regulations were passed in 2014 that
    require identification and an evaluation of the company’s _good faith
    efforts_ to recruit protected veterans and disabled individuals. This
    obligation will necessitate the contractor to list all of the recruiting
    efforts the company made during the calendar year, time period to recruit
    veterans and disabled individuals — along with an evaluation of the
    effectiveness of each effort.

    Failure to comply with the non-discrimination or affirmative action
    provisions is considered a violation. The Department of Labor’s Office of
    Federal Contract Compliance Program (OFCCP) is the agency with authority to
    enforce these laws by auditing a company’s AAP's and employment practices
    which could result in potential disbarment for seven years.

    year and retained.
