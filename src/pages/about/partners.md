      We have been recommending HR Strategies exclusively when our clients need
      anything HR related; from the very simple to the much more complex!  For
      our company, HR Strategies has handled searching for our New Hires,
      including testing, interviewing and narrowing down the candidate selection
      to the top three for interviewing.  This has been a tremendous time saver
      for us.  For our company, and for our clients, HR Strategies has
      conducted  training and education regarding FMLA, the new DE Sexual
      Harassment Law, Affirmative Action and others; created Employee Handbooks,
      and has just been a valuable resource to answer questions quickly or
      consult with on HR situations.  In today’s ever changing world of HR, it’s
      important to work with someone you know is going to stay up to date on the
      latest regulations and legislation and provide accurate information when
      we need it!  We highly recommend HR Strategies for any and all HR needs!
